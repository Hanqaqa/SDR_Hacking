FMPA
----

  FMPA is a simple tuner / NFM demodulator for use with DSD+ and Airspy devices.
  It samples at 2.5 MHz and displays 1.875 MHz of spectrum.

  FMPA operates very much like FMP.  Most of FMPA's command line options and active keys
  are identical to FMP.  These are detailed in the FMP.txt file.

  Options and features exclusive to FMPA are covered in this document.


  FMPA vs FMP differences:

    Three command line options and active keys to set gain levels.

    No PPM adjustment.

    Scanlist file name is "FMPA.ScanList"

    Airspy device numbers are based on Airspy serial numbers;
    lowest serial number = device #1, next highest serial number = #2, etc.
