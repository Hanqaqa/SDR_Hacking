DSD+ / FMP Trunk Voice Following
--------------------------------


Note:  NEXEDGE, Con+ and TIII (Hytera) trunking are fully supported

       Cap+ trunking is less supported (no rest channel following)


Note:  In order for trunk voice following to work, your DSDPlus.frequencies
       file *must* contain correct channel information for the systems / sites
       you wish to monitor.  If you have not done this, DSD+ cannot translate
       the over-the-air channel numbers into RF channel frequencies.  If you
       do not provide correct information, DSD+ will steer FMP to incorrect
       voice frequencies or do no tuning at all.


Note:  Where this document references RTL SDR dongles and the FMP program,
       you can substitute Airspy receivers and the FMPA program.
       E.g. where this document discusses using RTL SDR dongles in conjuction
       with FMP, Airspy/FMPA is equally applicable.


DSD+ trunk voice following uses two RF sources (control and voice) and
two instances of DSD+ (control and voice)

The control signal source can be any NFM receiver whose flat audio is piped to
DSD+ via a mic or line in input, or an SDR device (RTL SDR dongle, Airspy, etc.)
whose demodulated audio is routed to DSD+ via Virtual Audio Cable, VB Cable or a CP link.

The voice channel source must be a RTL SDR dongle that is being controlled by FMP or FMPA.
FMP/FMPA's audio output should be routed to DSD+ via a TCP link.

Sample batch files that run CC and VC copies of FMP/FMPA and DSD+ are provided;
they should be modified to match your specific monitoring setup.



Customizing
-----------

  the batch files assume that TCP port 20001 will be used for
  CC FMP/FMPA --> CC DSD+ audio linking

  the batch files assume that TCP port 20002 will be used for
  VC FMP/FMPA --> VC DSD+ audio linking

  if you are not using FMP or FMPA to feed the CC copy of DSD+, i.e. you're using
  a tapped radio or a program like SDR#, edit the CC.BAT file reflect the
  correct waveIn device number

  the PPM correction values in the FMP batch files should be changed to match your devices



Trunking
--------

  all batch files are designed to be run from your usual DSD+ folder;
  either start four console windows in that folder, or if using desktop shortcuts
  to run the batch files, specify that those shortcuts start in your usual DSD+ folder


  the CC source receiver can be a RTL SDR dongle, an Airspy or a discriminator-tapped radio

  if using a RTL SDR dongle, run the FMP-CC batch file, tune to an active CC,
  then adjust RF bandwidth filtering, RF gain, etc. as required

    pressing '?' will list all active keys in FMP's console window

  if using an Airspy, run the FMPA-CC batch file, tune to an active CC,
  then adjust RF bandwidth filtering, RF gain levels, etc. as required

  run the CC batch file to start the CC-decoding copy of DSD+

    if you have your CC audio routed correctly, DSD+ should start decoding and scrolling


  the VC source receiver *must* be a RTL SDR dongle or an Airspy


  run the FMP-VC or FMPA-VC batch file; FMP/FMPA should automatically enter trunk-following mode

    RF gain can be adjusted as required at any time

    you should see FMP/FMPA tuning to voice channels as comms show up on the CC


  run the VC batch file to start the VC-decoding copy of DSD+

    if you have your VC audio routed correctly, DSD+ should decode voice
    traffic as comms show up on the CC


Notes
-----

  the DSD+ window locations specified in the batch files are designed for
  a 1024x600 display screen

  for other screen sizes, move the DSD+ windows to more suitable locations
  and then press 'W' in each copy of DSD+; the current window locations
  will be listed in the event log windows; edit the CC and VC batch files
  to reflect the new screen locations


  as voice call announcements are broadcast on the control channel,
  the CC copy of DSD+ will create .traffic files

  the VC copy of FMP/FMPA will use these .traffic files to tune to voice channels

  FMP/FMPA will auto-select the RF bandwidth for followed voice calls


  the two copies of DSD+ will share/read/write the
  network/site/group/radio/frequency data files

  the data files may be edited (with Notepad, etc.) while DSD+ is running;
  any changes made will be picked up by DSD+



DSD+

  new command line parameters:

    -rc  DSD+ role is rest/control channel monitor

    -rv  DSD+ role is voice channel monitor


  traffic priorities can be raised and lowered by left/right clicking on comms
  in the CC channel activity window

    click in priority fields to change group priorities

    click in target alias/number fields to change group priority overrides

  higher priority traffic will preempt lower priority traffic

  left clicking on the CC channel activity window column headings will
  unlock any locked out talkgroups

  right clicking on the CC channel activity window column headings will
  clear an active hold
