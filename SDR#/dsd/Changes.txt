Changes from DSD+ 1.074 to DSD+ 1.101
-------------------------------------


  DSD+: Fixed AMBE tone frame audio generation.


  FMA: Added Airspy-compatible FMP (FMPA.exe)


  DSD+: Significant reduction in CPU usage when monitoring busy control channels.
  Improvement will be most noticeable on low power processors.


  DSD+: Detection and decoding of Hytera Extended Pseudo Trunk (XPT) systems.


  DSD+: The DSD+ -i command line parameter can contain an IPV4 address;
  this lets DSD+ connect to a copy of FMP that is running on a different
  PC in your local network or on the Internet

    Example:  DSDPlus -i192.168.1.150:20001


  DSD+: NEXEDGE radio alias editing

    DSD+ now marks auto-generated NEXEDGE radio aliases in the DSDPlus.radios
    file by prepending an asterisk like so:

      NEXEDGE, ... yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm,   *"aliastext"

    If you edit a NEXEDGE alias, you must remove the asterisk; this tells
    DSD+ that the new alias text is NOT auto-generated and DSD+ will not
    replace it with OTA alias text


  FP: FMP command line processing

    The FMP command line format has been modified and is now similar to
    the DSD+ command line.  A summary is listed here:

      FMP rev 1.4t

      Usage:
        FMP [options]   Normal operation
        FMP -h          Show help

      Options:
        -i<num>     RTL SDR device number (1-255) [-i1]
        -o<num>     Output audio device (1-255) [-o1]
        -o<port>    Output audio TCP port (256-65535)
        -P<num>     PPM value (-999.9-999.9) [-P0.0]
        -g<num>     RF gain (dB) [max]
        -f<MHz>     Initial tuned frequency [-f99.9]
        -b<kHz>     Initial filter bandwidth (4, 7, 9.5, 12.5) [-b7]
        -z<num>     Show zoomed spectrum (0-1) [-z1]
        -e<num>     Enable/disable economy mode (0-1) [-e1]
        -n<num>     Select noise filter (0-2) [-n0]
        -v<num>     Set volume level (0-500) [-v100]
        -s<num>     Enable/disable scanner mode (0-1) [-s0]
        -wsl<v>.<h> Spectrum window location [-wsl50.50]
        -_<num>     Minimize windows at startup; bitmapped
        -rv         Role is trunk voice channel monitor

    -rv puts FMP into voice following mode (same as pressing 'V' in FMP)

    Any shortcuts or batch files that run FMP will have to be modified
    to match the new command line format.


  DSD+: Less processor loading (probably only noticeable on very slow processors)


  DSD+: Much faster groups/radios files loading/saving


  DSD+: Editing existing radio aliases

    In previous versions of DSD+, editing of pre-existing radio aliases
    can not be done with an external text editor while DSD+ is running;
    only radio records with no alias text can be edited

    With DSD+ 1.092, existing radio alias text can be edited in an
    external text editor while DSD+ is running; DSD+ will load and display
    any updated radio aliases


  DSD+: A DSDPlus.radios file corruption bug has been fixed


  DSD+: A command line option to add system details to event log entries has been added

    -E          Add NAC/RAN/DCC/RAS data to event log file entries


  DSD+: Decoding of more DMR and TIII messages has been added


  DSD+: A symbol recovery bug has been fixed


  DSD+: Con+ handling has been modified; previous versions of DSD+ would create
  "DMR" entries in the DSDPlus.groups and DSDPlus.radios files for traffic
  on monitored voice channels; DSD+ 1.090 creates "Con+" entries; if you
  have "DMR" entries with nonzero NID fields, you should either bulk delete
  them or change their protocol string from "DMR" to "Con+"; Notepad has a
  simple search/replace function that can be used to do this


  DSD+: A command line option to minimize windows at startup has been added

    -_<num>     Minimize selected windows at startup (bitmapped, 0-15) [-_0]

    value  window

      1    console
      2    source audio
      4    channel activity
      8    event log

    sum values to minimize multiple windows


  DSD+: Several high contrast display modes have been added

    -H<num>     High contrast mode (bitmapped, 0-63) [-H0]

    two bits are used per graphical window; pressing 'H' in a window will
    cycle it to the next display mode; pressing 'W' displays the current
    -H<num> value in the event log window


  DSD+: Control of AMBE and IMBE unvoiced audio levels has been added

    -UA<num>    AMBE unvoiced speech level (0-100) [-UA50]
    -UI<num>    IMBE unvoiced speech level (0-100) [-UI50]

    pressing 'A'/'a'/'I'/'i' will also adjust the levels;
    lower levels may reduce the "underwater" sound of some comms


  DSD+: DSD+ can get its raw audio source from FMP via a TCP link instead of
  via Virtual Audio Cable or VB-Cable

    -i<TCPport> FMP TCP link port number (256-65535)

    linking FMP to DSD+ via VAC or VBC is deprecated; please use the TCP
    link feature instead; any port number between 10000 and 65000 should be fine


  DSD+: DSD+ can record separate .wav files for each voice call

    -P<wav|mp3> Also create per-call wav or mp3 files

    the file names encode metadata:

      time
      duration
      protocol
      NID
      site number
      NAC/RAN/DCC/slot
      call type (group/private)
      target
      source

    note: per-call mp3 files are not supported at this time


  FMP: A command line option to minimize windows at startup has been added

    -_<num>     Minimize selected windows at startup (bitmapped, 0-3) [-_0]

    value  window

      1    console
      2    spectrum display
